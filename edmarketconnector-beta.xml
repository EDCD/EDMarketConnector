<hr>

<h2>Release 5.8.0</h2>
<p>This release is essentially the same as 5.8.0-rc3 with only the version and
this changelog updated.</p>
<p>It brings a new feature related to Fleetcarrier data, some convenience for
Linux users, some fixes, and otherwise some internal changes that should not
adversely affect either users or third-party plugins.  For the latter, read
below for some new/changed things that could benefit you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This release, and all future ones, now create two additional archive files
in the GitHub release:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>EDMarketConnector-release-&lt;version&gt;.zip</code></li>
<li><code>EDMarketConnector-release-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The advantage of these over the GitHub auto-generated ones is that they
have been hand-crafted to contain <em>all</em> the necessary files, and <em>only</em>
those files.</p>
<p><strong>If you use the application from source, and not via a git clone, then we
highly recommend you use one of these archives, not the GitHub
auto-generated ones.</strong></p>
<p>Anyone installing on Windows should continue to use the
<code>EDMarketConnector_win_&lt;version&gt;.msi</code> files as before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Feature</strong> - You can now have the application query the <code>/fleetcarrier</code>
CAPI endpoint for data about your Fleet Carrier.  The data will then be
passed to interested plugins.</p>
<p>Note that there are some caveats:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This feature defaults to <em>Off</em>.  The option is on the Configuration tab
of Settings as "Enable Fleetcarrier CAPI Queries".  <strong>It is advised to only
enable this if you know you utilise plugins that make use of the data.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These queries are <em>only</em> triggered by <code>CarrierBuy</code> and <code>CarrierStats</code>
Journal events, i.e. upon buying a Fleetcarrier or opening the Carrier
Management UI in-game.  <strong>NB: There is a 15 minute cooldown between
queries.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have Fleetcarrier cargo which got into the cargo hold through a lot
of individual transactions, or if you have a lot of separate buy/sell
orders then these queries can take a <em>long</em> time to complete.</p>
<p><strong>If this happens with your game account then all other CAPI queries will
be blocked until the <code>/fleetcarrier</code> query completes.</strong>  'Other CAPI
queries' means those usually triggered upon docking to gather station
market, shipyard and outfitting data.  To ameliorate the effects of this
there is currently a timeout of 60 seconds on <code>/fleetcarrier</code> queries,
<strong>and will not occur more often than every 15 minutes</strong>.</p>
<p>We plan to address this by moving the <code>/fleetcarrier</code> queries into their
own separate thread in the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code for choosing the 'Output' folder is now simply the <code>tkinter</code>
function for such a dialogue, rather than a special case on Windows.  In
the past the former had issues with Unicode characters, but in testing no
such issue was observed (on a supported OS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are two new items on the "Help" menu:</p>
<ol>
<li>Troubleshooting -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Troubleshooting">Wiki:Troubleshooting</a>
</li>
<li>Report A Bug -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug%2C+unconfirmed&amp;template=bug_report.md&amp;title=">Issues - New Bug Report</a>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Translations have been updated.  Thanks again to our volunteer translators!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we ever activate any functionality killswitches, the popup denoting which
are active has been made more readable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's a new section in <code>Contributing.md</code> - "Python Environment".  This
should aid any new developers in getting things set up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="user-content-linux-users" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#linux-users"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Linux Users</h2>
<p>We now ship an <code>io.edcd.EDMarketConnector.desktop</code> file.  To make use of this
you should run <code>scripts/linux-setup.sh</code> <em>once</em>.  This will:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Check that you have <code>$HOME/bin</code> in your PATH.  If not, it will abort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a shell script <code>edmarketconnector</code> in <code>$HOME/bin</code> to launch the
application.</p>
<p>NB: This relies on the filesystem location you placed the source in not
changing. So if you move the source you will need to re-run the script.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the .desktop and .icon files into appropriate locations.  The .desktop
file utilises the shell script created in step 2, and thus relies on it
existing <em>and</em> on it being in a directory that is in your PATH.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once this has been completed any XDG-compliant desktops should have an entry
for "E:D Market Connector" in their "Games" menu.</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-fixes" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fixes"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The tracking of a Cmdr's location that was being performed by the core EDDN
plugin has been moved into the Journal monitoring code.  This results in
the tracking being correct upon application (re)start, reflecting the state
from the latest Journal file, rather than only picking up with any
subsequent new Journal events.</p>
<p>This change should remove instances of "Wrong System! Missed Jump ?" and
similar sanity-check "errors" when continuing to play after a user restarts
the application whilst the game is running.</p>
<p>Plugin developers, see below for how this change can positively affect you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name of the files written by "File" &gt; "Save Raw Data" now have a <code>.</code>
between the system and station names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of CAPI data in <code>EDMC.exe</code> when invoked with either <code>-s</code> or <code>-n</code>
arguments hadn't been updated for prior changes, causing such invocations to
fail.  This has been fixed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="user-content-plugin-developers" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#plugin-developers"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plugin Developers</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each plugin is now handed its own sub-frame as the <code>parent</code> parameter passed
to <code>plugin_app()</code> <em>instead of the actual main UI frame</em>.  These new Frames
are placed in the position that plugin UI would have gone into. This should
have no side effects on well-behaved plugins.</p>
<p>However, if you have code that attempts to do things like <code>parent.children()</code>
or the like in your <code>plugin_app()</code> implementation, this might have stopped
working.  You shouldn't be trying to do anything with any of the UI outside
your plugin <em>anyway</em>, but if you definitely have a need then look things up
using <code>.nametowidget()</code>.  There are examples in the core plugins (which <em>DO</em>
have good reason, due to maintaining main UI label values).</p>
<p>All of the plugins listed on our Wiki were given <em>perfunctory</em> testing and no
issues from this change were observed.</p>
<p>This is a necessary first step to some pending plugin/UI work:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/1792">UI: Alllow for re-ordering third-party plugins' UIs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/1813">UI: Allow configuration of number of UI columns.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/1814">Re-work how Plugins' Settings are accessed</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New</strong> - <code>capi_fleetcarrier()</code> function to receive the data from a CAPI
<code>/fleetcarrier</code> query.  See PLUGINS.md for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was found that the <code>ShutDown</code> event (note the capitalisation, this is
distinct from the actual Journal <code>Shutdown</code> event) synthesized for plugins
when it is detected that the game has exited was never actually being
delivered. Instead this was erroneously replaced with a synthesized <code>StartUp</code>
event. This has been fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the location tracking has been moved out of the core EDDN plugin, and into
monitor.py all of it is now available as members of the <code>state</code> dictionary
which is passed to <code>journal_entry()</code>.</p>
<p>This both means that no plugin should need to perform such location state
tracking itself <em>and</em> they can take advantage of it being fully up to date
when a user restarts the application with the game running.</p>
<p>A reminder: When performing 'catch up' on the newest Journal file found at
startup, the application does <strong>not</strong> pass any events to the
<code>journal_entry()</code> method in plugins.  This is to avoid spamming with
data/state that has possibly already been handled, and in the case of the
Cmdr moving around will end up not being relevant by the time the end of the
file is reached.  This limitation was also why the core EDDN plugin couldn't
properly initiate its location tracking state in this scenario.</p>
<p>See PLUGINS.md for details of the new <code>state</code> members.  Pay particular
attention to the footnote that details the caveats around Body tracking.</p>
<p>Careful testing has been done for <em>only</em> the following. So, if you make use
of any of the other new state values and spot a bug, please report it:</p>
<ol>
<li>SystemName</li>
<li>SystemAddress</li>
<li>Body (Name)</li>
<li>BodyID</li>
<li>BodyType</li>
<li>StationName</li>
<li>StationType</li>
<li>(Station) MarketID</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an additional property <code>request_cmdr</code> on <code>CAPIData</code> objects, which
records the name of the Cmdr the request was made for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>FDevIDs</code> files are their latest versions at time of this version's build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>examples\plugintest</code> - dropped the "pre-5.0.0 config" code, as it's long
since irrelevant.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If you utilise a git clone of the source code, you should also ensure the
sub-modules are initialised and synchronised.
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Running-from-source#obtain-a-copy-of-the-application-source">wiki:Running from source</a>
has been updated to include the necessary commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>coriolis-data</code> git sub-module now uses an HTTPS, not "git" URL, so won't
require authentication for a simple <code>git pull</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a <code>dump</code> directory in CWD when running EDMarketConnector.py under
a debugger you will get files in that location when CAPI queries complete.
This will now include files with names of the form
<code>FleetCarrier.&lt;callsign&gt;.&lt;timstamp&gt;.json</code> for <code>/fleetcarrier</code> data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the main UI tk widgets are now properly named.  This might make things
easier if debugging UI widgets as you'll no longer see a bunch of <code>!label1</code>,
<code>!frame1</code> and the like.</p>
<p>Each plugin's separator is named as per the scheme <code>plugin_hr_&lt;X&gt;</code>, and when
a plugin has UI its new container Frame is named <code>plugin_X</code>.  Both of these
start with <code>1</code>, not <code>0</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 5.7.0</h2>
<p>This release re-enables CAPI queries for Legacy players.  As a result, the
'Update' button functionality is now restored for Legacy players, along with
"Automatically update on docking" functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We now test against, and package with, Python 3.11.1, 32-bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This release is functionally identical to 5.7.0-rc1, as no problems were
reported with that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As noted above, Legacy players now have CAPI functionality once more.
Plugin developers check below for how you can determine the source galaxy
of such data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to a bug it turned out that a workaround for "old browsers don't support
very long URLs" had been inactive since late 2019.  As no-one has noticed
or complained we've now removed the defunct code in favour of the simple
<code>webbrowser.open(&lt;url&gt;)</code>.</p>
<p>Testing showed that all of Firefox, Chrome and Chrome-based Edge worked with
very long URLs without issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>EDMC.exe -n</code> had been broken for a while, it now functions once more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some output related to detecting and parsing <code>gameversion</code> from Journals
has been moved from INFO to DEBUG.  This returns the output of any <code>EDMC.exe</code>
command to the former, quieter, version.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="user-content-bugs" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bugs"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A corner case of "game not running" and "user presses 'Update' button" would
result in an empty <code>uploaderID</code> string being sent to EDDN.  Such messages are
still accepted by the EDDN Gateway, and the Relay then obfuscates this field
anyway.  So, at worse, this would make it look like the same uploader was in
lots of different places.  This has been fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The message about converting legacy <code>replay.jsonl</code> was being emitted even
when there was no file to convert.  This has been fixed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="user-content-plugin-developers" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#plugin-developers"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plugin Developers</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An erroneous statement about "all of Python stdlib" in PLUGINS.md has been
corrected.  We don't/can't easily include all of this.  Ask if any part of it
you require is missing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to not pass Legacy data to plugins without them being aware of it
there is now a new function <code>cmdr_data_legacy()</code>, which mirrors the
functionality of <code>cmdr_data()</code>, but for Legacy data only.  See PLUGINS.md
for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>data</code> passed to <code>cmdr_data()</code> and <code>cmdr_data_legacy()</code> is now correctly
typed as <code>CAPIData</code>.  This is a sub-class of <code>UserDict</code>, so you can continue
to use it as such.  However, it also has one extra property, <code>source_host</code>,
which can be used to determine if the data was from the Live or Legacy
CAPI endpoint host.  See PLUGINS.md for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any plugin had been attempting to make use of <code>config.get_int('theme')</code>,
then be aware that we've finally moved from hard-coded values to actual
defined constants.  Example use would be as in:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python"><pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">config</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">config</span>
<span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">theme</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">theme</span>

<span class="pl-s1">active_theme</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">config</span>.<span class="pl-en">get_int</span>(<span class="pl-s">'theme'</span>)
<span class="pl-k">if</span> <span class="pl-s1">active_theme</span> <span class="pl-c1">==</span> <span class="pl-s1">theme</span>.<span class="pl-v">THEME_DARK</span>:
    ...
<span class="pl-k">elif</span> <span class="pl-s1">active_theme</span> <span class="pl-c1">==</span> <span class="pl-s1">theme</span>.<span class="pl-v">THEME_TRANSPARENT</span>:
    ...
<span class="pl-k">elif</span> <span class="pl-s1">active_theme</span> <span class="pl-c1">==</span> <span class="pl-s1">theme</span>.<span class="pl-v">THEME_DEFAULT</span>:
    ...
<span class="pl-k">else</span>:
    ...</pre></div>
<p>But remember that all tkinter widgets in plugins will inherit the main UI
current theme colours anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contents of <code>NavRoute.json</code> will now be loaded during 'catch-up' when
EDMarketConnector is (re-)started.  The synthetic <code>StartUp</code> (note the
capitalisation) event that is emitted after the catch-up ends will have
<code>state['NavRoute']</code> containing this data.</p>
<p>However, the <code>Fileheader</code> event from detecting a subsequent new Journal file
<em>will</em> blank this data again.  Thus, if you're interested in "last plotted
route" on startup you should react to the <code>StartUp</code> event.  Also, note that
the contents <em>will</em> indicate a <code>NavRouteClear</code> if that was the last such
event.</p>
<p>PLUGINS.md has been updated to reflect this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you've ever been in the habit of running our <code>develop</code> branch, please
don't.  Whilst we try to ensure that any code merged into this branch doesn't
contain bugs, it hasn't at that point undergone more thorough testing.
Please use the <code>stable</code> branch unless otherwise directed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some small updates have been made in <code>edmc_data</code> as a part of reviewing the
latest update to <code>coriolis-data</code>.
We make no guarantee about keeping these parts of <code>edmc_data</code> up to date.
Any plugins attempting to use that data should look at alternatives, such
as <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/FDevIDs/blob/master/outfitting.csv">FDevIDs/outfitting.csv</a>.</p>
<p>A future update might remove those maps, or at least fully deprecate their
use by plugins.  Please contact us <strong>now</strong> if you actually make use of this
data.</p>

<h2>Release 5.6.1</h2>
<p>This release addresses some minor bugs and annoyances with v5.6.0, especially
for Legacy galaxy players.</p>
<p>In general, at this early stage of the galaxy split, we prefer to continue to
warn Legacy users who have 'send data' options active for sites that only
accept Live data.  In the future this might be reviewed and such warnings
removed such that the functionality <em>fails silently</em>.  This might be of use
to users who actively play in both galaxies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CAPI queries will now <strong>only be attempted for Live galaxy players</strong>  This is
a stop-gap whilst the functionality is implemented for Legacy galaxy players.
Doing so prevents using Live galaxy data whilst playing Legacy galaxy, which
would be increasingly wrong and misleading.</p>
<ol>
<li>'Automatic update on docking' will do nothing for Legacy players.</li>
<li>Pressing the 'Update' button whilst playing Legacy will result in a status
line message "CAPI for Legacy not yet supported", and otherwise achieve
nothing.  <strong>The only function of this button is to query CAPI data and
pass it to plugins, which does <em>not</em> include Inara and EDSM</strong>.</li>
<li>A Legacy player trying to use "File" &gt; "Status" will get the message
"Status: No CAPI data yet" due to depending on CAPI data.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is hoped to implement CAPI data retrieval and use for Legacy players soon,
although this will likely entail extending the plugins API to include a new
function specifically for this.  Thus only updated plugins would support
this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EDDN: Where data has been sourced from the CAPI this application now sends
a header-&gt;gameversion in the format <code>"CAPI-(Live|Legacy)-&lt;endpoint"</code> as per
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDDN/blob/live/docs/Developers.md#gameversions-and-gamebuild">the updated documentation</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As <em>this</em> version only queries CAPI for Live players that will only be
<code>"CAPI-Live-&lt;endpoint&gt;"</code> for the time being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, somehow, the CAPI host queried matches neither the
current Live host, the Legacy host, nor the past beta host, you will see
<code>"CAPI-UNKNOWN-&lt;endpoint&gt;"</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As that statement implies, this application will also signal 'Live' if
<code>pts-companion.orerve.net</code> has been used, due to detecting an alpha or beta
version of the game.  However, in that case the <code>/test</code> schemas will be used.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Closes <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/1734">#1734</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inara: Only warn about Legacy data if sending is enabled in Settings &gt; Inara.</p>
<p>Closes <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/1730">#1730</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inara: Handling of some events has had a sanity check added so that the
Inara API doesn't complain about empty strings being sent.  In these cases
the event will simply not be sent.</p>
<p>Closes <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/1732">#1732</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EDSM: EDSM has decided to accept only Live data on its API.  Thus, this
application will only attempt to send data for Live galaxy players.</p>
<p>If a Legacy galaxy player has the Settings &gt; EDSM &gt; "Send flight log and
Cmdr status to EDSM" option active then they will receive an error about
this at most once every 5 minutes.  Disabling that option will prevent the
warning.</p>

<ul>
<li>PLUGINS.md has been updated to make it clear that the only use of imports
from the <code>config</code> module are for setting/getting/removing a plugin's own
configuration, or detecting application shutdown in progress.</li>
<li>PLUGINS.md has also been updated to add a note about how the <code>data</code> passed
to a plugin <code>cmdr_data()</code> is, strictly speaking, an instance of <code>CAPIData</code>,
which is an extension of <code>UserDict</code>.  It has some extra properties on it,
<strong>but these are for internal use only and no plugin should rely on them</strong>.</li>
<li>As noted above, implementing CAPI data for Legacy players will likely entail
an additional function in the API provided to plugins.  See
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/1728">#1728</a> for discussion
about this.</li>

<h2>Release 5.6.0</h2>
<p>Tha major reason for this release is to address the Live versus Legacy galaxy
split <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/news/elite-dangerous-update-14-and-beyond-live-and-legacy-modes" rel="nofollow">coming in Update 14 of the game</a>.
See the section "Update 14 and the Galaxy Split" below for how this might
impact you.</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-changes" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#changes"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We now test against, and package with, Python 3.10.8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code for sending data to EDDN has been reworked.  This changes the
'replay log' from utilising an internal array, backed by a flat file
(<code>replay.jsonl</code>), to an sqlite3 database.</p>
<p>As a result:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any messages stored in the old <code>replay.jsonl</code> are converted at startup,
if that file is present, and then the file removed.</li>
<li>All new messages are stored in this new sqlite3 queue before any attempt
is made to send them.  An immediate attempt is then made to send any
message not affected by "Delay sending until docked".</li>
<li>Sending of queued messages will be attempted every 5 minutes, unless
"Delay sending until docked" is active and the Cmdr is not docked in
their own ship.  This is in case a message failed to send due to an issue
communicating with the EDDN Gateway.</li>
<li>When you dock in your own ship an immediate attempt to send all queued
messages will be initiated.</li>
<li>When processing queued messages the same 0.4-second inter-message delay
as with the old code has been implemented.  This serves to not suddenly
flood the EDDN Gateway.  If any message fails to send for Gateway reasons,
i.e. not a bad message, then this processing is abandoned to wait for
the next invocation.</li>
</ol>
<p>The 5-minute timer in point 3 differs from the old code, where almost any
new message sending attempt could initiate processing of the queue.  At
application startup this delay is only 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Currently, the feedback of "Sending data to EDDN..." in the UI status line
has been removed.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not have "Delay sending until docked" active, then the only
messages that will be at all delayed will be where there was a communication
problem with the EDDN Gateway, or it otherwise indicated a problem other
than 'your message is bad'.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of this EDDN rework this application now sends appropriate
<code>gameversion</code> and <code>gamebuild</code> strings in EDDN message headers.
The rework was necessary in order to enable this, in case of any queued
or delayed messages which did not contain this information in the legacy
<code>replay.jsonl</code> format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For EDSM there is a very unlikely set of circumstances that could, in theory
lead to some events not being sent.  This is so as to safeguard against
sending a batch with a gameversion/build claimed that does not match for
<em>all</em> of the events in that batch.</p>
<p>It would take a combination of "communications with EDSM are slow", more
events (the ones that would be lost), a game client crash, <em>and</em> starting
a new game client before the 'more events' are sent.</p>

<p>Due to the galaxy split <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/news/elite-dangerous-update-14-and-beyond-live-and-legacy-modes" rel="nofollow">announced by Frontier</a>
there are some changes to the major third-party websites and tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inara <a href="https://inara.cz/elite/board-thread/7049/463292/#463292" rel="nofollow">has chosen</a>
to only accept Live galaxy data on its API.</p>
<p>This application will not even process Journal data for Inara after
2022-11-29T09:00:00+00:00 <em>unless the <code>gameversion</code> indicates a Live client</em>.
This explicitly checks that the game's version is semantically equal to or
greater than '4.0.0'.</p>
<p>If a Live client is <em>not</em> detected, then there is an INFO level logging
message "Inara only accepts Live galaxy data", which is also set as the main
UI status line.  This message will repeat, at most, every 5 minutes.</p>
<p>If you continue to play in the Legacy galaxy only then you probably want to
just disable the Inara plugin with the checkbox on Settings &gt; Inara.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All batches of events sent to EDSM will be tagged with a <code>gameversion</code>, in
a similar manner to the EDDN header.</p>
<p>Ref: <a href="https://www.edsm.net/en/api-journal-v1" rel="nofollow">EDSM api-journal-v1</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All EDDN messages will now have appropriate <code>gameversion</code> and <code>gamebuild</code>
fields in the <code>header</code> as per
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDDN/blob/live/docs/Developers.md#gameversions-and-gamebuild">EDDN/docs/Developers.md</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of this you can expect third-party sites to choose to filter data
based on that.</p>
<p>Look for announcements by individual sites/tools as to what they have chosen
to do.</p>

<h2><a id="user-content-known-bugs" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#known-bugs"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known Bugs</h2>
<p>In testing if it had been broken at all due to 5.5.0 -&gt; 5.6.0 changes it has
come to light that <code>EDMC.EXE -n</code>, to send data to EDDN, was already broken in
5.5.0.</p>
<p>In addition, there is now some extra 'INFO' logging output which will be
produced by any invocation of <code>EDMC.EXE</code>.  This might break third-party use of
it, e.g. <a href="https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/trade-computer-extension-mk-ii.223056/" rel="nofollow">Trade Computer Extension Mk.II</a>.
This will be fixed as soon as the dust settles from Update 14, with emphasis
being on ensuring the GUI <code>EDMarketConnector.exe</code> functions properly.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Where EDMC sourced data from the Journal files it will set <code>gameversion</code>
and <code>gamebuild</code> as per their values in <code>Fileheader</code> or <code>LoadGame</code>, whichever
was more recent (there are some events that occur between these).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>If any message was already delayed such that it did not
have the EDDN header recorded, then the <code>gameversion</code> and <code>gamebuild</code> will
be empty strings</em>.  In order to indicate this the <code>softwareName</code> will have
<code> (legacy replay)</code> appended to it, e.g. <code>E:D Market Connector Connector [Windows] (legacy replay)</code>.  In general this indicates that the message was
queued up using a version of EDMC prior to this one.  If you're only
interested in Live galaxy data then you might want to ignore such messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where EDMC sourced data from a CAPI endpoint, the resulting EDDN message
will have a <code>gameversion</code> of <code>CAPI-&lt;endpoint&gt;</code> set, e.g. <code>CAPI-market</code>.
<strong>At this time it is not 100% certain which galaxy this data will be for, so
all listeners are advised to ignore/queue such data until this is clarified</strong>.</p>
<p><code>gamebuild</code> will be an empty string for all CAPI-sourced data.</p>

<code>EXIT_SYS_ERR</code> (6) for some cases.  See the appropriate line in EDMC.py for
details.</p>


<h2>Release 5.3.4</h2>
<p>Whilst EDMarketConnector.exe was fixed for the Odyssey Update 11 difference in Journal file names, EDMC.exe was not.   If you're wondering, that's the command-line utility that, for instance, Trade Computer Extensions uses to obtain data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the new common function for finding latest journal file in EDMC.py.</li>
<li>Quietens some NavRoute related logging for the benefit of EDMC.py.  This is
now at DEBUG level, rather than INFO.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Release 5.3.3</h2>
<p>Unfortunately 5.3.2 failed to fully address the issues caused by the different
Journal filenames when using the Odyssey Update 11 client.  It's fine if you
run EDMarketConnector first and <em>then</em> the game, as the code path that detects
a new file always does just that.</p>
<p>But the code for EDMarketConnector startup to find the current newest Journal
file relied on sorting the filenames and that would mean the new-style names
would always sort as 'oldest'.</p>
<p>This release fixes that code to properly use the file modification timestamp
to determine the newest file on startup.</p>


<h2>Release 5.3.2</h2>
<p>This release contains one change to cope with how Frontier decided to name
the Journal files differently in the Update 11 Odyssey client.</p>

<p>If you use a sub-class for a widget the core code will no longer break if
your code raises an exception.  e.g. a plugin was failing due to Python
3.10 using <code>collections.abc</code> instead of <code>collections</code>, and the plugin's
custom widget had a <code>configure()</code> method which was called by the core
theme code on startup or theme change.  This then caused the whole
application UI to never show up on startup.</p>
<p>This also applies if you set up a button such that enter/leave on it, i.e.
mouse in/out, causes the <code>theme.py</code> code for that to trigger.</p>
<p>So, now in such cases the main UI should actually show up, although your
plugin's UI might look weird due to theming not being properly applied.</p>
<p>The plugin exception <strong>WILL</strong> be logged, at ERROR level.</p>

</ul>


<h2>Release 5.3.0</h2>
<p>As has sadly become routine now, please read
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Troubleshooting#installer-and-or-executables-flagged-as-malicious-viruses">our statement about malware false positives</a>
affecting our installers and/or the files they contain.  We are as confident
as we can be, without detailed auditing of python.org's releases and all
the py2exe source and releases, that there is no malware in the files we make
available.</p>
<p>This release is primarily aimed at fixing some more egregious bugs,
shortcomings and annoyances with the application.  It also adds support for
two additional
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDDN/blob/live/README.md">EDDN</a>
schemas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We now test and build using Python 3.10.2.  We do not <em>yet</em> make use of any
features specific to Python 3.10 (or 3.9).  Let us restate that we
absolutely reserve the right to commence doing so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now set a custom User-Agent header in all web requests, i.e. to EDDN,
EDSM and the like.  This is of the form:</p>
<p><code>EDCD-EDMarketConnector-&lt;version&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"File" -&gt; "Status" will now show the new Odyssey ranks, both the new
categories and the new 'prestige' ranks, e.g. 'Elite I'.</p>
<p><strong>NB: Due to an oversight there are currently no translations for these.</strong></p>
<p>Closes <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/1369">#1369</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running <code>EDMarketConnector.exe --reset-ui</code> will now also reset any changes to
the application "UI Scale" or geometry (position and size).</p>
<p>Closes <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/1155">#1155</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now use UTC-based timestamps in the application's log files.  Prior to
this change it was the "local time", but without any indication of the
applied timezone.  Each line's timestamp has <code> UTC</code> as a suffix now.  We
are assuming that your local clock is correct <em>and</em> the timezone is set
correctly, such that Python's <code>time.gmtime()</code> yields UTC times.</p>
<p>This should make it easier to correlate application logfiles with in-game
time and/or third-party service timestamps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process used to build the Windows installers should now always pick up
all the necessary files automatically.  Prior to this we used a manual
process to update the installer configuration which was prone to both user
error and neglecting to update it as necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the application fails to load valid data from the <code>NavRoute.json</code> file
when processing a Journal <code>NavRoute</code> event, it will attempt to retry this
operation a number of times as it processes subsequent Journal events.</p>
<p>This should hopefully work around a race condition where the game might
not have yet updated <code>NavRoute.json</code> at all, or has truncated it to empty,
when we first attempt this.</p>
<p>We will also now <em>NOT</em> attempt to load <code>NavRoute.json</code> during the startup
'Journal catch-up' mode, which only sets internal state.</p>
<p>Closes <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/1155">#1348</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inara: Use the <code>&lt;journal log&gt;-&gt;Statistics-&gt;Bank_Account-&gt;Current_Wealth</code>
value when sending a <code>setCommanderCredits</code> message to Inara to set
<code>commanderAssets</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, a <code>setCommanderCredits</code> message at game login <strong>will now only
ever be sent at game login</strong>.  Yes, you will <strong>NEED</strong> to relog to send an
updated balance.  This is the only way in which to sanely keep the
'Total Assets' value on Inara from bouncing around.</p>

game on-foot.  Previously you would <em>HAVE</em> to be in a ship at login time

or progress since the session started.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Inara: You should once more see updates for any materials used in
Engineering.  The bug was in our more general Journal event processing
code pertaining to <code>EngineerCraft</code> events, such that the state passed to
the Inara plugin hadn't been updated.</p>
<p>Such updates should happen 'immediately', but take into account that there
can be a delay of up to 35 seconds for any data sent to Inara, due to how
we avoid breaking the "2 messages a minute" limit on the Inara API.</p>

<p>EDDN: We now compress all outgoing messages.  This might help get some
particularly large <code>navroute</code> messages go through.</p>
<p>If any message is now rejected as 'too large' we will drop it, and thus
not retry it later.  The application logs will reflect this.</p>
<p>NB: The EDDN Gateway was updated to allow messages up to 1 MiB in size
anyway.  The old limit was 100 KiB.</p>

<li>
<p>EDDN: In an attempt to diagnose some errors observed on the EDDN Gateway
with respect to messages sent from this application some additional checks
and logging have been added.</p>
<p><strong>NB: After some thorough investigation it was concluded that these EDDN
errors were likely the result of long-delayed messages due to use of
the "Delay sending until docked" option.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Use a different workaround for OneSky (translations website) using "zh-Hans"
for Chinese (Simplified), whereas Windows will call this "zh-CN". This is
in-code and documented with a comment, as opposed to some 'magic' in the
Windows Installer configuration that had no such documentation. It's less
fragile than relying on that, or developers using a script/documented
process to rename the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As noted above we forgot to upload to
<a href="https://marginal.oneskyapp.com/collaboration/project/52710" rel="nofollow">OneSky</a>
after adding the Odyssey new ranks/categories.  This has now been done,
and some new phrases await translation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 5.2.4</h2>
<p>This is a <em>very</em> minor update that simply imports the latest versions of
data files so that some niche functionality works properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Update <code>commodity.csv</code> and <code>rare_commodity.csv</code> from the latest
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/FDevIDs">EDCD/FDevIDs</a> versions.  This addresses
an issue with export of market data in Trade Dangerous format containing
<code>OnionHeadC</code> rather than the correct name, <code>Onionhead Gamma Strain</code>, that
Trade Dangerous is expecting.</p>
<p>This will only have affected Trade Dangerous users who use EDMarketConnector
as a source of market data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Release 5.2.3</h2>
<p>This release fixes one bug and fixes some example code.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Odyssey changed the order of some Journal events.  This caused our logic
for tracking the following to break, and thus not report them ever to Inara:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ship Combat, Trade and Exploration ranks.</li>
<li>On-foot Combat and Exobiologist ranks.</li>
<li>Engineer unlocks and progress.</li>
<li>Reputations with Major Factions (Superpowers).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is now fixed and the current state of all of these will be correctly
reported to Inara if you have API access for it configured.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a id="user-content-developers" class="anchor" href="#developers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Developers</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now built using Python 3.9.9.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/blob/main/PLUGINS.md#packaging-extra-modules">PLUGINS.md</a>
to state that we don't actually include <em>all</em> of Python's standard library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/tree/main/docs/examples/click_counter">click_counter</a>
example plugin code has been corrected to both actually work fully, and pass
our linting.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Release 5.2.2</h2>
<p>This release adds one new feature and addresses some bugs.  We've also
updated to using Python 3.9.8.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Windows now has "minimize to system tray" support.</p>
<ul>
<li>The system tray icon will always be present.</li>
<li>There is a new option on the Settings &gt; Appearance tab -
<code>Minimize to system tray</code>.</li>
<li>When this new option is active, minimizing the application will <em>also</em>
hide the taskbar icon.</li>
<li>When the new option is not active, the application will minimize to the
taskbar as normal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-bug-fixex" class="anchor" href="#bug-fixex" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bug Fixex</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a CAPI query failed in such a way that no <code>requests.Response</code> object
was made available we attempted to blindly dump the non-existent object.<br>
We now check that it actually exists, and log the specifics of the exception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A user experienced the game writing a NavRoute.json file without a
<code>Route</code> array, which caused the application to attempt sending a badly formed
<code>navroute</code> message to EDDN.  That message was then remembered and constantly
retried.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We now sanity check the NavRoute.json contents to be sure there <em>is</em> a
<code>Route</code> array, even if it is empty.  If it's not present no attempt
to send the EDDN message will be made.</p>
<p>If this scenario occurs the user will see a status line message <code>No  'Route' array in NavRoute.json contents</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any EDDN message that receives a 400 status back we will drop it
from the replay log.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Release 5.2.1</h2>
<p>This release primarily addresses the issue of the program asking for
Frontier authorization much too often.</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually utilise the Frontier Refresh Token when the CAPI response is
"Unauthorized".  The re-factoring of this code to make CAPI queries
threaded inadvertently prevented this.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 5.2.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The 'Update' button is disabled if CQC/Arena is detected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frontier CAPI queries now run in their own thread.  There should be no
change in functionality for users.   This affects both EDMarketConnector
(GUI) and EDMC (command-line).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>File</code> &gt; <code>Status</code> will now use cached CAPI data, rather than causing a fresh
query.  <strong>Currently if data has not yet been cached nothing will happen when
trying to use this</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trying to use <code>File</code> &gt; <code>Status</code> when the current commander is unknown, or
there is has been no CAPI data retrieval yet, will now result in the 'bad'
sound being played and an appropriate status line message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>File</code> &gt; <code>Save Raw Data</code> also now uses the cached CAPI data, rather than
causing a fresh query.  This will write an empty JSON <code>{}</code> if no data is
yet available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New <a href="docs/Licenses/">docs/Licenses/</a> directory containing all relevant
third-party licenses for the software this application uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Settings</code> &gt; <code>Output</code> &gt; <code>File Location</code> 'Browse' button will now always be
available, even if no output options are active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 'no git installed' logging when running from source is now at INFO
level, not ERROR.  This will look less scary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EDMarketConnetor command-line arguments have been re-ordered into
logical groups for <code>--help</code> output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support added for several new EDDN schemas relating to specific Journal
events.  The live EDDN server has been updated to support these.</p>
<p>Schema support added for:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>codexentry/1</code></li>
<li><code>fssdiscoveryscan/1</code></li>
<li><code>navbeaconscan/1</code></li>
<li><code>navroute/1</code></li>
<li><code>scanbarycentre/1</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a message to EDDN gets an 'unknown schema' response it will <strong>NOT</strong> be
saved in the replaylog for later retries, instead being discarded.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Pressing the 'Update' button when in space (not docked, not on a body
surface) will no longer cause a spurious "Docked but unknown station: EDO
Settlement?" message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug preventing <code>--force-localserver-auth</code> from working has been fixed.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Now built using Python 3.9.7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New <code>journal_entry_cqc()</code> function for plugins to receive journal events
<em>specifically and <strong>only</strong> when the player is in CQC/Arena</em>.  This allows
for tracking things that happen in CQC/Arena without polluting
<code>journal_entry()</code>.  See <a href="PLUGINS.md">PLUGINS.md</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Command-line argument <code>--trace-all</code> to force all possible <code>--trace-on</code> to be
active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributing.md has been updated for how to properly use <code>trace_on()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EDMC.(py,exe) now also makes use of <code>--trace-on</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EDMarketConnector now has <code>--capi-pretend-down</code> to act as if the CAPI
server is down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Killswitches now have support for removing key/values entirely, or forcing
the value.  See <a href="docs/Killswitches.md">docs/Killswitches.md</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state['Odyssey']</code> added, set from <code>LoadGame</code> journal event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now test against a different EDDN server using <code>--eddn-url</code>
command-line argument.  This needs to be the <em>full</em> 'upload' URL, i.e. for
the live instance this is <code>https://eddn.edcd.io:4430/upload/</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New command-line argument <code>--eddn-tracking-ui</code> to track the EDDN plugin's
idea of the current BodyName and BodyID, from both the Journal and
Status.json.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 5.1.3</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attempt to flush any pending EDSM API data when a Journal <code>Shutdown</code> or
<code>Fileheader</code> event is seen.  After this, the data is dropped.  This ensures
that, if the user next logs in to a different commander, the data isn't then
sent to the wrong EDSM account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure a previous Journal file is fully read/drained before starting
processing of a new one.  In particular, this ensures properly seeing the end
of a continued Journal file when opening the continuation file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New config options, in a new <code>Privacy</code> tab, to hide the current Private
Group, or captain of a ship you're multi-crewing on.  These usually appear
on the <code>Commander</code> line of the main UI, appended after your commander name,
with a <code>/</code> between.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EDO dockable settlement names with <code>+</code> characters appended will no longer
cause 'server lagging' reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't force DEBUG level logging to the
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Troubleshooting#plain-log-file">plain log file</a>
if <code>--trace</code> isn't used to force TRACE level logging.  This means logging
<em>to the plain log file</em> will once more respect the user-set Log Level, as in
the Configuration tab of Settings.</p>
<p>As its name implies, the <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Troubleshooting#debug-log-files">debug log file</a>
will always contain at least DEBUG level logging, or TRACE if forced.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>New EDMarketConnector option <code>--trace-on ...</code> to control if certain TRACE
level logging is used or not.  This helps keep the noise down whilst being
able to have users activate choice bits of logging to help track down bugs.</p>
<p>See <a href="Contributing.md#use-the-appropriate-logging-level">Contributing.md</a> for
details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loading of <code>ShipLocker.json</code> content is now tried up to 5 times, 10ms apart,
if there is a file loading, or JSON decoding, failure.  This should
hopefully result in the data being loaded correctly if a race condition with
the game client actually writing to and closing the file is encountered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>config.get_bool('some_str', default=SomeDefault)</code> will now actually honour
that specified default.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 5.1.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Journal event change in EDO Update 6 will have caused some translated
suit names to not be properly mapped to their sane versions.  This change
has now been addressed and suit names should always come out as intended in
the EDMarketConnector.exe UI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a new command-line argument to cause all Frontier Authorisation to
be forgotten:  <code>EDMarketConnector.exe --forget-frontier-auth</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Situations where Frontier CAPI data doesn't agree on the location we have
tracked from Journal events will now log more useful information.</p>

<p>We now store <code>GameLanguage</code>, <code>GameVersion</code> and <code>GameBuild</code> in the <code>state</code>
passed to <code>journal_entry()</code> from the <code>LoadGame</code> event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various suit data, i.e. class and mods, is now stored from relevant
Journal events, rather than only being available from CAPI data.  In
general we now consider the Journal to be the canonical source of suit
data, with CAPI only as a backup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backpack contents should now track correctly if using the 'Resupply' option
available on the ship boarding menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now cache the main application version when first determined, so
that subsequent references to <code>config.appversion()</code> won't cause extra log
spam (which was possible when, e.g. having a git command but using non-git
source).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 5.1.1</h2>
<p>The big change in this is adjustments to be in line with Journal changes in
Elite Dangerous Odyssey 4.0.0.400, released 2021-06-10, with respect to the
Odyssey materials Inventory.</p>
<p><strong>This update is mandatory if you want EDMarketConnector to update Inara.cz
with your Odyssey inventory.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ShipLockerMaterials</code> is dead, long live <code>ShipLocker</code>.  Along with other
changes to how backpack inventory is handled we should now actually be
able to fully track all Odyssey on-foot materials and consumables without
errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inara plugin adjusted to send the new <code>ShipLocker</code> inventory to Inara.cz.
This is <em>still</em> only your <em>ship</em> inventory of Odyssey materials, not
anything currently in your backpack whilst on foot.
See <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/1162">this issue</a>
for some quotes from Artie (Inara.cz developer) about <em>not</em> including
backpack contents in the Inara inventory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Errors related to sending data to EDDN are now more specific to aid in
diagnoising issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quietened some log output if we encounter connection errors trying to
utilise the Frontier CAPI service.</p>

<p>We'll be fully addressing translations in a near-future release after we've
conclude the necessary code level work for the new system.  Nothing should
change for those of you helping on OneSky, other than at most the
'comments' on each translation.  They should be more useful!</p>

<li>
<p><code>state</code> passed to <code>journal_entry()</code> now has <code>ShipLockerJSON</code> which contains
the <code>json.load()</code>-ed data from the new 'ShipLocker.json' file.  We do
attempt to always load from this file, even when the <code>ShipLocker</code> Journal
event itself contains all of the data (which it does on startup, embark and
disembark), so it <em>should</em> always be populated when plugins see any event
related to Odyssey inventory.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Release 5.1.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updates to how this application utilises the Inara.cz API.</p>
<ol>
<li>The current state of your ShipLockerMaterials (MicroResources for Odyssey
Suit and handheld Weapons upgrading and engineering) will now be sent.
Note that we can't reliably track this on the fly, so it will only
update when we see a full <code>ShipLockerMaterials</code> Journal event, such as
at login or when you disembark from any vehicle.</li>
<li>Odyssey Suits and their Loadouts will now be sent.</li>
<li>When you land on a body surface, be that in your own ship, in a Taxi,
or in a Dropship.  Depending on the exact scenario a Station might be
sent along with this.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now both edit the 'normal' and 'beta' coriolis.io URLs, and
choose which of them are used.  'Auto' means allowing the application to
use the normal one when you're running the live game, or the beta version
if running a beta version of the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suit names will now be displayed correctly when we have pulled the data
from the Frontier CAPI, rather than Journal entries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many translations updated once more, especially for new strings.  Thanks
as always to those contributing!</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't assume we have an EDSM Commander Name and/or API key just because
we know a game Commander name.  This came to light during the
investigation of
"<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/1134">EDSM Plugin sent wrong credit balance when switching accounts</a>".
We're still investigating that bug report.</li>

<p>There are some new members of the <code>state</code> dictionary passed to
<code>journal_entry()</code>; Taxi, Dropship, Body and BodyType.  See
<a href="./PLUGINS.md">PLUGINS.md</a> for the details.</p>

<h2>Release 5.0.4</h2>
<p>This is a minor bugfix release, ensuring that Odyssey Suit names (and loadout)
will actually display if you're in your ship on login and never leave it.</p>
<p>NB: This still requires a Frontier CAPI data pull, either automatically
because you're docked if you have that option set, or by pressing the
'Update' button.  We can't display data when we don't have it from either
CAPI or Journal sources.  You'll also see '<code>&lt;Unknown&gt;</code>' between the time we
see the Journal LoadGame event during login and when there's either a
Journal suit-related event, or a CAPI data pull completes.</p>


<h2>Release 5.0.3</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can now click on a 'cell' in the "File" &gt; "Status" popup to copy that
text to the clipboard.  This was a relatively easy, and non-intrusive, code
change.  We'll look at richer, fuller, copy functionality in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suit names, for all grades, should now be displaying as just the relevant
word, never a symbol, and with the redundant 'suit' word(s) from all
languages removed.  Note that Frontier have <em>not</em> translated the
following, so neither do we: "Artemis", "Dominator", "Maverick".  The 'Flight
Suit' should, approximately, use the Frontier-supplied translation for
'Flight' in this context.  In essence the displayed name is now as short
as possible whilst disambiguating the suit names from each other.</p>

<p>The check for "source, but with extra changes?" in appversion will now

<p>The backpack and ship locker tracking of micro-resources <strong>might</strong> now
actually be correct with respect to 'reality' in-game.  This is in part
thanks to Frontier changes to some events in 4.0.0.200.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suit names will now only be sourced from Journal events if the
application didn't (yet) have the equivalent CAPI data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The displayed Suit name is stored in an extra "edmcName" key within
<code>state['Suits']</code> and <code>state['SuitCurrent']</code>.  What was found in the
Journal or CAPI data is still present in the "name" and "locName" values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "language", "gameversion" and "build" values from the "Fileheader" event
are all now stored in <code>state[]</code> fields.  See <a href="./PLUGINS.md">PLUGINS.md</a> for
updated documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a new <a href="./Contributing.md">Contributing.md</a> policy of adding
comments in a defined format when we add or change code such that there's a
'hack', 'magic' or 'workaround' in play.  You might find some of this
enlightening going forwards.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 5.0.2</h2>
<p>This release is primarily aimed at getting the UI "<code>Suit: ...</code>" line working
properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The "<code>Suit: ...</code>" UI line should now function as best it can given the
available data from the game.  It should not appear if you have launched
the Horizons version of the game, even if your account has Odyssey
enabled.  You might see "<code>&lt;Unknown&gt;</code>" as the text when this application
does not yet have the required data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changed the less than obvious "<code>unable to get endpoint: /profile</code>" error
message to "<code>Frontier CAPI query failure: /profile</code>", and similarly for the
other CAPI endpoints we attempt to access.  This new form is potentially
translated, but translators need time to do that.</p>
<p>In addition the old message "<code>Received error {r.status_code} from server</code>"
has been changed to "<code>Frontier CAPI server error: {r.status_code}</code>" and is
potentially translated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The filenames used for 'Market data in CSV format file' will now be sane,
and as they were before 5.0.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux: 'Shipyard provider' will no longer default to showing 'False' if
no specific provider has been selected.</p>

currently the correct case) file that is written when there's a <code>BackPack</code>
(guess what, yes, that is currently the correct case) event written to
the Journal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state['Credits']</code> tracking is almost certainly not perfect.  We're
accounting for the credits component of <code>SuitUpgrade</code> now, but there
might be other such we've yet accounted for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state['Suits']</code> and associated other keys should now be tracking from
Journal events, where possible, as well as CAPI data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a section in PLUGINS.md about how to package an extra Python
module with your plugin.  Note the new caveat in
<a href="./PLUGINS.md#avoiding-potential-pitfalls">PLUGINS.md:Avoiding-pitfalls</a>
about the name of your plugin's directory.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 5.0.1</h2>
<p>The main reason for this release is to add an 'odyssey' boolean flag to all
EDDN messages for the benefit of listeners, e.g. eddb.io, inara.cz,
edsm.net, spansh.co.uk, etc.  <strong>Please do update so as to make their lives
easier once Odyssey has launched!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Translations have been updated again.  Thanks to all the contributors.
See <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Translations">wiki:Translations</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/24">Translations welcome</a>
for links and discussion if you want to help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changed the error message "<code>Error: Frontier server is down</code>" to
"<code>Error: Frontier CAPI didn't respond</code>" to make it clear this pertains to
the CAPI and not the game servers.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a id="user-content-killswitches" class="anchor" href="#killswitches" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Killswitches</h2>
<p>In the 5.0.0 changelog we said:</p>
  <blockquote>We will **NOT** be using this merely to try and get some
  laggards to upgrade.</blockquote>
<p>However, from now on there is an exception to this.  <strong>After</strong> this
release any subsequent -beta or -rc versions will be killswitched <em>after</em>
their full release is published.</p>
<p>For example, if we put out a <code>5.0.2-beta1</code> and <code>5.0.2-rc1</code> before the full
<code>5.0.2</code>, then when <code>5.0.2</code> was published we would activate all available
killswitches for versions <code>5.0.2-beta1</code> and <code>5.0.2-rc1</code>.  In this example
<code>5.0.1</code> would <strong>not</strong> be killswitched as part of <em>this policy</em> (but still
could be if, e.g. a data corruption bug was found in it).</p>
<p>In general please do <strong>not</strong> linger on any -beta or -rc release if there
has been a subsequent release.  Upgrade to the equivalent full release once it
is published.</p>

<li>Navigate to <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector">EDMarketConnector</a>.</li>
<li>Click the 'Watch' (or 'Unwatch' if you previously set up any watches on

top-right of the page.</li>
<li>Click 'Custom'.</li>
<li>Ensure 'Releases' is selected.</li>
<li>Click 'Apply'.</li>

<p>This way you'll be aware, as early as possible, of any -beta and -rc
changelogs and changes that might affect your work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state</code> passed to <code>journal_entry()</code> has a new member <code>Odyssey</code> (note the
capital <code>O</code>) which is a boolean indicating if the <code>LoadGame</code> event both has
an <code>Odyssey</code> key, and if so, what the value was.  Defaults to <code>False</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PLUGINS.md updated to document the <code>state['Horizons']</code> flag that has been
present in it since version 3.0 of the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>stations.p</code> and <code>systems.p</code> files that were deprecated in 5.0.0 have
now also been removed in git.  As this release is made they will no
longer be in the <code>develop</code>, <code>main</code> or <code>stable</code> branches.  If you truly
need to find a copy look at the <code>Release/4.2.7</code> tag, but do read the 5.0.0
changelog for why we stopped using them and what you can change to also
not need them.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 5.0.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We now test against, and package with, Python 3.9.5.</p>
<p><strong>As a consequence of this we no longer support Windows 7.<br>
This is due to
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/" rel="nofollow">Python 3.9.x itself not supporting Windows 7</a>.
The application (both EDMarketConnector.exe and EDMC.exe) will crash on
startup due to a missing DLL.</strong></p>
<p>This should have no other impact on users or plugin developers, other
than the latter now being free to use features that were introduced since the
Python 3.7 series.</p>
<p>Developers can check the contents of the <code>.python-version</code> file
in the source (it's not distributed with the Windows installer) for the
currently used version in a given branch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-this-update-is-mandatory" class="anchor" href="#this-update-is-mandatory" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>This Update Is Mandatory</h2>
<p>This release is a <strong>mandatory upgrade for the release of Elite Dangerous
Odyssey</strong>.  Any bug reports against earlier releases, pertaining to Odyssey or
not, will be directed to reproduce them with 5.0.0 or later.  There are also
minor bugs in 4.2.7 and earlier that have been fixed in this version.  There
will <strong>NOT</strong> be another 4.2.x release.</p>
<p>The major version has been incremented not for Odyssey support, but because
we have made some minor breaking changes to the APIs we provide for plugin
developers.</p>
<p>Due to these plugin API changes (see below) users might need to update their
plugins.  A check of all the
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Plugins#available-plugins---confirmed-working-under-python-37">Plugins we know about</a>
only found one with an issue related to the move to <code>edmc_data.py</code>, the
developer was informed and the issue addressed.</p>
<p>Other plugins should, at most, log deprecation warnings about the
<code>config</code> changes (again, see below).</p>
<p><strong>In the first instance please report any issues with plugins to <em>their</em>
developers, not us.  They can contact us about EDMC core code issues if
they find such in their investigations.</strong></p>
<p>All plugin developers would benefit from having a GitHub account and then
setting up a watch on <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/">EDMarketConnector</a>
of at least 'Releases' under 'Custom'.</p>
<p>NB: If you had any beta or -rc1 of 5.0.0 installed and see anything weird
with this full release it would be advisable to manually uninstall, confirm
the installation directory (default <code>c:\Program Files (x86)\EDMarketConnector</code>)
is empty, and then re-install 5.0.0 to be sure you have a clean, working,
install.  Anyone upgrading from 4.2.7 or earlier shouldn't see any issues
with this.</p>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-changes-and-enhancements" class="anchor" href="#changes-and-enhancements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Changes and Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the application detects it's running against a non-live (alpha or beta)
version of the game it will append " (beta)" to the Commander name on the
main UI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated translations.  Once more, thanks to all the translators!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now sanity check a returned Frontier Authentication token to be sure
it's for the current Commander.  If it's not you'll see
<code>Error: customer_id doesn't match!</code> on the bottom status line.  Double-check
you're using the correct credentials when authing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New 'Main window transparency' slider on <code>Settings</code> &gt; <code>Appearance</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New command-line argument for EDMarketConnector.exe <code>--reset-ui</code>.  This will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reset to the default Theme.</li>
<li>Reset the UI transparency to fully opaque.</li>
</ol>
<p>The intention is this can be used if you've lost sight of the main window
due to tweaking these options.</p>
<p>There is a new file <code>EDMarketConnector - reset-ui.bat</code> to make utilising
this easy on Windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New CL arg for EDMarketConnector.exe <code>--force-edmc-protocol</code>.
This is really only of use to core developers (its purpose being to force
use of the <code>edmc://</code> protocol for Frontier Auth callbacks, even when not
'frozen').</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux config will be flushed to disk after any change.  This means that
EDMC.py can now actually make use of the latest CAPI auth if it's been
updated by EDMarketConnector.py since that started.</p>
<p>If you want to run multiple instances of the application under Linux then
please check the updated <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Troubleshooting#multi-accounting">Troubleshooting: Multi-Accounting</a>
wiki entry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux and macOS: You can now set a font name and size in your config file.<br>
Ensuring this is a TTF font, rather than a bitmap font, should allow the
application UI scaling to work.</p>
<ol>
<li>'font' - the font name to attempt using</li>
<li>'font_size' - the font size to attempt using.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no UI for this in Preferences, you will need to edit your
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Troubleshooting#location-of-configuration-files">config file</a>
to set or change it, and then restart the application.</p>
<p>This is not supported on Windows so as not to risk weird bugs.  UI
Scaling works on Windows without this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now also cite the git 'short hash' in the version string.  For a Windows
install of the application this is sourced from the <code>.gitversion</code> file
(written during the build process).</p>
<p>When running from source we attempt to use the command <code>git rev-parse --short HEAD</code>
to obtain this.  If this doesn't work it will be set to 'UNKNOWN'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have added a 'killswitch' feature to turn off specific functionality if it
is found to have a bug.  An example use of this would be in an "oh
shit! we're sending bad data to EDDN!" moment so as to protect EDDN
listeners such as EDDB.</p>
<p>If we ever have to use this we'll announce it clearly and endeavour to
get a fixed version of the program released ASAP.  We will <strong>NOT</strong> be
using this merely to try and get some laggards to upgrade.</p>
<p>Plugin Developers: See <a href="./docs/Killswitches.md">Killswitches.md</a> for more
information about this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our logging code will make best efforts to still show class name and
other such fields if it has trouble finding any of the required data for
the calling frame.  This means no longer seeing <code>??:??:??</code> when there is
an issue with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>macOS: We've managed to test the latest code on macOS Catalina.  Other than
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/906">keyboard shortcut support not working</a>
it appears to be working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've pulled the latest Coriolis data which might have caused changes to
ship and module names as written out to some files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-odyssey" class="anchor" href="#odyssey" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Odyssey</h2>
<p>Every effort was made during the Odyssey Alphas to ensure that this
application will continue to function correctly with it.  As always, make a
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug%2C+unconfirmed&amp;template=bug_report.md&amp;title=">Bug Report</a>
if you find anything not working, but be sure to check our
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/618">Known Issues</a> first.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new UI element 'Suit' now appears below 'Ship' when applicable. It
details the type of suit you currently have equipped and its Loadout name.<br>
This UI element is collapsed/hidden if no suit/on-foot state is detected,
e.g. not playing Odyssey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that we can only reliably know about Suits and their Loadouts from a
CAPI data pull (which is what we do automatically on docking if
configured to do so, or when you press the 'Update' button).  We do
attempt to gather this data from Journal events as well, but if you
switch to a Suit Loadout that hasn't been mentioned in them yet we won't
be able to display that until the next CAPI data pull.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone becomes aware of a 'suit loadouts' site/tool, a la Coriolis/EDSY
but for Odyssey Suits, do let us know so we can add support for it!
We're already kicking around ideas to e.g. place JSON text in the clipboard
if the Suit Loadout is clicked.</p>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-bug-fixes" class="anchor" href="#bug-fixes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix ship loadout export to files to not trip up in the face of file encoding
issues. This relates to the 'Ship Loadout' option on the 'Output' tab of
Settings/Preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ship Type/Name will now be greyed out, and not clickable, if we don't
currently have loadout information for it.  This prevents trying to send an
empty loadout to your shipyard provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bug fixed when handling CAPI-sourced shipyard information.  This happens
due to a Frontier bug with not returning shipyard data at all for normal
stations.</p>
<p>It has been observed that Frontier has fixed this bug for Odyssey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't try to get Ship information from <code>LoadGame</code> event if directly in CQC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inara: Don't attempt to send an empty
<code>setCommanderReputationMajorFaction</code> API call.  This quietens an error
from the Inara API caused when a Cmdr literally has no Major Faction
Reputation yet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-code-clean-up" class="anchor" href="#code-clean-up" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code Clean Up</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Code pertaining to processing Journal events was reworked and noisy logging
reduced as a consequence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A little TRACE logging output has been commented out for now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code for <code>File</code> &gt; <code>Status</code> has been cleaned up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Localisation code has been cleaned up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code handling the Frontier Authorisation callback on Windows has been
cleaned up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of general code cleanup relating to: Inara, outfitting, Frontier
CAPI, hotkey (manual Updates), dashboard (Status.json monitoring),
commodities files, and ED format ship loadout files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-plugin-developers" class="anchor" href="#plugin-developers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plugin Developers</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The files <code>stations.p</code> and <code>systems.p</code> have been removed from the Windows
Installer.  These were never intended for third-party use.  Their use in
core code was for generating EDDB-id URLs, but we long since changed the
EDDB plugin's handlers for that to use alternate URL formats based on
game IDs or names.</p>
<p>If you were using either to lookup EDDB IDs for systems and/or stations
then please see how <code>system_url()</code> and <code>station_url()</code> now work in
<code>plugins/eddb.py</code>.</p>
<p>This change also removed the core (not plugin) <code>eddb.py</code> file which
generated these files.  You can find it still in the git history if needs
be.  It had gotten to the stage where generating <code>systems.p</code> took many
hours and required 64-bit Python to have any hope of working due to
memory usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All static data that is
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/blob/main/PLUGINS.md#available-imports">cleared for use by plugins</a>
is now in the file
<code>edmc_data.py</code> and should be imported from there, not <em>any</em> other module.</p>
<p>The one thing we didn't move was the 'bracket map' dictionaries in <code>td.py</code>
as they're for use only by the code in that file.</p>
<p>All future such data will be added to this file, and we'll endeavour not
to make breaking changes to any of it without increasing our Major version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>config.appversion()</code> is now a function that returns a <code>semantic_version.Version</code>.
In contexts where you're expecting a string this should mostly
just work.  If needs be wrap it in <code>str()</code>.</p>
<p>For backwards compatibility with pre-5.0.0 you can use:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python"><pre>    <span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">config</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">appversion</span>

    <span class="pl-k">if</span> <span class="pl-en">callable</span>(<span class="pl-s1">appversion</span>):
        <span class="pl-s1">edmc_version</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">appversion</span>()
    <span class="pl-k">else</span>:
        <span class="pl-s1">edmc_version</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">appversion</span></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example plugin
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/tree/main/docs/examples/plugintest">plugintest</a>
updated.  This includes an example of how to check core EDMC version if needs
be.  This example is also in
<a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/blob/main/PLUGINS.md#checking-core-edmc-version">PLUGINS.md</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>config.py</code> has undergone a major rewrite.  You should no longer be using
<code>config.get(...)</code> or <code>config.getint(...)</code>, which will both give a
deprecation warning.<br>
Use instead the correct <code>config.get_&lt;type&gt;()</code> function:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>config.get_list(&lt;key&gt;)</code></li>
<li><code>config.get_str(&lt;key&gt;)</code></li>
<li><code>config.get_bool(&lt;key&gt;)</code></li>
<li><code>config.get_int(&lt;key&gt;)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Setting still uses <code>config.set(...)</code>.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace all instances of <code>config.get()</code> and <code>config.getint()</code> as above.</li>
<li>For ease of maintaining compatibility with pre-5.0.0 versions include
this code in at least one module/file (no harm in it being in all that
manipulate plugin config):</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>from config import config

# For compatibility with pre-5.0.0
if not hasattr(config, 'get_int'):
    config.get_int = config.getint

if not hasattr(config, 'get_str'):
    config.get_str = config.get

if not hasattr(config, 'get_bool'):
    config.get_bool = lambda key: bool(config.getint(key))

if not hasattr(config, 'get_list'):
    config.get_list = config.get
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Utilising our provided logging from a class-level, i.e. not a solid
instance of a class, property/function will now work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now change the current working directory of EDMarketConnector.exe to
its location as soon as possible in its execution.  We're also
paranoid about ensuring we reference the full path to the <code>.gitversion</code> file.</p>
<p>However, no plugin should itself call <code>os.chdir(...)</code> or equivalent.  You'll
change the current working directory for all core code and other plugins as
well (it's global to the whole <strong>process</strong>, not per-thread).  Use full
absolute paths instead (<code>pathlib</code> is what to use for this).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>state</code> dict passed to plugins in <code>journal_entry()</code> calls (which is
actually <code>monitor.state</code> in the core code) has received many additions
relating to Odyssey, as well as other fixes and enhancements.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Support has been added for the <code>NavRoute</code> (not <code>Route</code> as v28 of the
official Journal documentation erroneously labels it) Journal event and
its associated file <code>NavRoute.json</code>.  See <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/blob/main/PLUGINS.md#journal-entry">PLUGINS.md:Events documentation</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, there is now support for the <code>ModuleInfo</code> event and its
associated <code>ModulesInfo.json</code> file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state['Credits']</code> - until now no effort was made to keep this
record of the credits balance up to date after the initial <code>LoadGame</code>
event.  This has now been addressed, and the balance should stay in sync
as best it can from the available Journal events.  It will always correct
back to the actual balance on each CAPI data pull or game relog/restart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state['Cargo']</code> now takes account of any <code>CargoTransfer</code> events.
This was added to the game in the Fleet Carriers update, but also covers
transfers to/from an SRV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state['OnFoot']</code> is a new boolean, set true whenever we detect
the Cmdr is on-foot, i.e. not in any type of vehicle (Cmdr's own ship,
SRV, multi-crew in another Cmdr's ship, Apex taxi, or a Dropship).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state['Suits']</code> and <code>state['SuitLoadouts']</code> added as <code>dict</code>s containing
information about the Cmdr's owned Suits and the Loadouts the Cmdr has
defined to utilise them (and on-foot weapons).
Note that in the raw CAPI data these are arrays if all members
contiguously exist, else a dictionary, but we have chosen to always coerce
these to a python <code>dict</code> for simplicity.  They will be empty <code>dict</code>s, not
<code>None</code> if there is no data.<br>
We use the CAPI data names for keys, not the Journal ones - e.g. <code>slots</code>
for weapons equipped, not <code>Modules</code>.
The <code>id</code> field found on e.g. weapon details in suit loadouts may be <code>None</code>
if we got the data from the Journal rather than the CAPI data.
NB: This data is only guaranteed up to date and correct after a fresh CAPI
data pull, as the current Journal events don't allow for updating it on the
fly (this should change in a future Odyssey patch).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state['SuitCurrent']</code> and <code>state['SuitLoadoutCurrent']</code> contain the
obvious "currently in use" data as per the Suits/SuitLoadouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tracking of the new Odyssey 'Microresources' has been added:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>Component</code> - <code>dict</code> for 'Ship Locker' inventory.</li>
<li>
<code>Item</code> - <code>dict</code> for 'Ship Locker' inventory.</li>
<li>
<code>Consumable</code> - <code>dict</code> for 'Ship Locker' inventory.</li>
<li>
<code>Data</code> - <code>dict</code> for 'Ship Locker' inventory.</li>
<li>
<code>BackPack</code> - on-foot inventory, a <code>dict</code> containing again
dicts for <code>Component</code>, <code>Item</code>, <code>Consumable</code> and <code>Data</code>.
However note that the lack of a Journal event when throwing a grenade,
along with no <code>BackPackMaterials</code> event if logging in on-foot means that
we can't track the BackPack inventory perfectly.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>See the updated <code>PLUGINS.md</code> file for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As <code>Status.json</code>, and thus the EDMC 'dashboard' output now has a 'flags2'
key we have added the associated constants to <code>edmc_data.py</code> with a
<code>Flags2</code> prefix on the names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that during the Odyssey Alpha it was observed that the CAPI
<code>data['commander']['docked']</code> boolean was <strong>always true</strong> if the Cmdr was
in their ship.  This is a regression from pre-Odyssey behaviour.  The
core EDMC code copes with this.  Please add a reproduction to the issue
about this:
