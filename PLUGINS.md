# EDMC Plugins

Plugins allow you to customise and extend the behavior of EDMC.

# Writing a Plugin

Plugins are loaded when EDMC starts up.

Each plugin has it's own folder in the `plugins` directory:

* Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EDMarketConnector\plugins`
* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/EDMarketConnector/plugins`
* Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/EDMarketConnector/plugins`, or `~/.local/share/EDMarketConnector/plugins` if `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is unset.

Plugins are python files. The plugin folder must have a file named `load.py` that must provide one module level function and optionally provide a few others.

EDMC will import the `load.py` file as a module and then call the `plugin_start()` function.

```
def plugin_start():
   """
   Load this plugin into EDMC
   """
   print "I am loaded!"
```

# Plugin Hooks
## Configuration 

If you want your plugin to be configurable via the GUI you can define a frame (panel) to be displayed on it's own tab in EDMC's settings dialog. Use widgets from EDMC's myNotebook.py for the correct look-and-feel.

You can use `set()`, `get()` and `getint()` from EDMC's config object to store and retrieve your plugin's settings in a platform-independant way.

```
import myNotebook as nb
from config import config

def plugin_prefs(parent):
   """
   Return a TK Frame for adding to the EDMC settings dialog.
   """
   frame = nb.Frame(parent)
   nb.Label(prefs, text="Hello").grid()
   nb.Label(prefs, text="Commander").grid()
   
   return frame
```

## Display

You can also have your plugin add an item to the EDMC main window and update it if you need to from your event hooks. This works in the same way as `plugin_prefs()`. For a simple one-line item return a ttk.Label widget. For a more complicated item create a ttk.Frame widget and populate it with other ttk widgets.

```
def plugin_app(parent):
   """
   Create a TK widget for the EDMC main window
   """
   plugin_app.status = ttk.Label(parent, text="Status:")
   return plugin_app.status
   
# later on your event functions can directly update plugin_app.status["text"]
plugin_app.status['text'] = "Status: Happy!"
```

## Events

Once you have created your plugin and EDMC has loaded it there are two other functions you can define to be notified by EDMC when something happens: `system_changed()` and `cmdr_data()`.

Your events all get called on the main tkinter loop so be sure not to block for very long or the EDMC will appear to freeze. If you have a long running operation then you should take a look at how to do background updates in tkinter - http://effbot.org/zone/tkinter-threads.htm

### Arriving in a System

This gets called when EDMC uses the netlog to notice that you have arrived at a new star system.

```
def system_changed(timestamp, system):
   """
   We arrived at a new system!
   """
   sys.stderr.write("{} {}".format(timestamp, system))
```

### Getting Commander Data

This gets called when EDMC has just fetched fresh data from Frontier's servers.

```
def cmdr_data(data):
   """
   We have new data on our commander
   """
   sys.stderr.write(data.get('commander') and data.get('commander').get('name') or '')
```

The data is a dictionary and full of lots of wonderful stuff!
