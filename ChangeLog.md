Release Candidate 4.0.3-rc3
===

  In addition to changes in [4.0.3-rc1](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/releases/tag/Release%2F4.0.3-rc1)
and [4.0.3-rc2](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/releases/tag/Release%2F4.0.3-rc2):

 * A fix for ships without a player-set name using a single ` ` (space
  character) as their name in the UI, instead of the ship model name.
  
    See [#614 - Ship is not displaying but IS hotlinked](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/614).
    
 * A fix for some file paths on Linux not understanding `~` as "my home
 directory".  This should help anyone using Manjaro Linux.
 
    See [#486 - Some info about running on Manjaro](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/486).
    
 * A new option to use an alternate method of opening a URL for shipyard links.
 It's called 'Use alternate URL method' and is located in the 'File' >
 'Settings' dialogue on the 'Configuration' tab, next to the dropdown used to
 choose shipyard provider.  If your setup results in coriolis.io or edsy.org
 saying they can't load your build then try toggling this on.
 
    This method writes a small .html file in `%LOCALAPPDATA\EDMarketConnector\ `
    (or other-OS equivalent) and directs your browser to open that. The file
    contains a meta refresh redirect to the URL for your build on your chosen
    shipyard provider.
    
    **Please let us know if this doesn't work for you!**
    Anti-Virus or Software Firewalls might object to the "open .html file, and
    then it redirects" workaround.
    
    See [#617 - Ship load out link error](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/617).

Release Candidate 4.0.3-rc2
===

This is exactly the same as -rc1 except I fixed a missing line of code that
prevented the EDSM plugin from loading.

Release Candidate 4.0.3-rc1
===

The main purpose of this Pre-Release is to test fixes to the System and Station
provider code supplied by the internal plugins.  But we've also now switched
to full [Semantic Version](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver)
strings.

 * Switch to Semantic Version strings.
    * As part of this the version check with `EDMC.exe -v` might now show
     some exception/error output if it fails to download and parse the appcast
     file.  The string it shows, new version available or not, should be the
     same format as previously.

 * Fix for bug [#616 - EDMC Not Showing "Station" after Update](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/616)
  This was caused by changes to the *EDDB* plugin inadvertently no longer
  maintaining some state that it turned out the *Inara* plugin was depending
  on.
    * Inara plugin is now using direct URLs for System and Station links.  IT
     no longer relies on you having entered an Inara API Key.
    * All three 'provider' plugins (EDDB, EDSM, Inara) should now be using the
     same logic for when they update and what they display.
    * If you Request Docking, whether the request succeeds or not, the
     station name will now show and be clickable.
    * If you Undock, Supercruise away or FSDJump away any station name will
     be replaced with a `×` character.  As with unpopulated systems clicking
     this will take you either to the system page, or to a list of stations
     in the system (depending on provider used).

    There'll likely be a refactor of these plugins in the future.
    
    For now please test that this functionality is working as expected.

Release 4.0.2.0
===
Only a minor fix to EDMC.exe

 * Restore the reporting of new releases for `EDMC.exe -v`.
 
Release 4.0.1.0
===
This fixes a bug with the EDDB 'System Provider' URLs.

 * It was possible to pick up, and use, a bad SystemAddress from the Frontier
 CAPI.  The CAPI will no longer be used as a source for this.
 * If we do not yet have a SystemAddress from the Journal we will use the
 SystemName instead.  This carries the small risk of the player being in one
 of the duplicate-name systems, in which case EDDB might not display the
 correct system.
 
Release 4.0.0.0
===
Developers please note the new [Contributing.md](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/blob/main/Contributing.md)
, particularly [Git branch structure and tag conventions](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/blob/main/Contributing.md#git-branch-structure-and-tag-conventions)
.

 * This release is based on Python 3.7, not 2.7, so a user might find some of
   their plugins stop working.  If you have any plugins that do not have the
   proper support you'll see a popup about this when you
   start the program, at most once every 24 hours.  As directed on that
    popup you can check the status of
   your plugins on 'File' > 'Settings' > 'Plugins' in the new 'Plugins Without
   Python 3.x Support:' section.
 
   If the popup gets annoying then follow the directions to
   [disable a plugin](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/blob/main/PLUGINS.md#disable-a-plugin).  
   
   For any plugins without Python 3.x support you should first ensure you're
   using the latest version of that plugin.  If that hasn't been updated then
   you might want to contact the plugin developer to see if they'll update the
   plugin.  We've checked many plugins and put them in the appropriate
   section of [this list](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Plugins#available-plugins---confirmed-working-under-python-37).
 
    *Plugin authors should also read the latest [Developer Plugin
     Documentation](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/blob/main/PLUGINS.md)
     ,* **particularly the section
      [Available imports](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/blob/main/PLUGINS.md#available-imports)
     .** Let us know if we've missed anything.
     
 * New 'Help' > 'About E:D Market Connector' menu item to show the currently
   running version.  Includes a link to the release notes.

 * Translations updated:
   * New languages: Serbian (Latin, Bosnia and Herzegovina),
     Slovenian (Slovenia) and Swedish.
     
   * New phrases were added and the only 100% translated languages are now:
     Czech, French, German, Japanese, Polish, Portugese (Brazil),
     Portugese (Portugal), Russian, Serbian (Latin),
     Serbian (Latin, Bosnia and Herzegovina), Spanish, Swedish (Sweden)
     Ukrainian,
     
   Thank you translators! Please do contribute on
   [the OneSkyApp project](https://marginal.oneskyapp.com/collaboration/project/52710)
   if you are able to.
     
 * EDDB plugin now uses a system's SystemAddress to construct the URL to view
   the system on eddb.io.  This removes the need for the systems.p file.
   That file will be removed in a future version, plugin authors should not
   be relying on its presence.

 * EDDB plugin now uses a station's MarketID to construct a URL to view the
   station on eddb.io.  This removes the need for stations.p.  That file will
   be removed in a future version, plugin authors should not be relying on its
   presence.
 
   NB: It's now using the system's "Population" data from Journal messages to
   determine if the system has stations or not.  This allows for the `×` as
   station name to be clickable to open the eddb.io page for system when you're
   not docked.  It's known that some systems with stations have a Population of
   "0" and thus won't allow this functionality.  This is Frontier's issue, not
   EDMC's.  If you logged out in a populated system, run EDMC afresh, and use
   the 'Update' button you won't see the `×` until you login fully to the game.
   
 * Tweak to Inara plugin so it will send updates via the Inara API more
   frequently.  Will now send an update, no more often than about once a
   minute, if your cargo changes at all.  This still won't update if you dock
   and quickly buy or sell some cargo, but it's better than it was before.
   You can nudge it by waiting a minute then re-opening the Commodities screen,
   or indeed performing any other action the logs a new Journal event.

 * The old 'anonymous' and custom 'uploaderID' options were taken out of
   the UI back in December 2018, but the settings lingered in the Windows
   Registry. Thus some users would still have been sending an anonymised or
   custom 'uploaderID' in EDDN messages with no easy way to de-activate this.
 
    The EDDN Relay has been forcefully anonymising uploaderID since March
    2018 anyway, so this is redundant.  Thus the code that performs this
    anonymisation has now been removed.
    
 * There used to be an option to output commodities data in 'BPC' format, but
   it was removed from the UI back in Dec 2016.  A few small pieces of code
   lingered and they have now been removed.  Any plugin that was passing
   `COMMODITY_BPC` to `commodity.export()` will now break.
   
 * Fixed a bug where certain combinations of 'Output' and 'EDDN' options would
   lead to all options on both tabs reverting to their defaults.
   
 * Fixed a bug where if you copied a Journal file to the live location,
   resulting in a "Journal.YYMMDDHHMMss.XX - Copy.log" file, the application
   would pick it up as 'new' and potentially re-send duplicate data to all of
   EDDN, EDSM and Inara.
   
   Now the only files the application will take note of must:
    1. Start with `Journal.` or `JournalBeta.`.
    1. Have the 12-digit date/timestamp, followed by a `.`
    1. Have the 2 digit serial number, followed by a `.`
    1. Nothing else before the trailing `log`.
    
 * Fixed the location of Registry keys for the update checker, WinSparkle:
   * To be under the new `EDCD` Registry key in
    `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\`.
   * To be under `EDMarketConnector` instead of `EDMarketConnector.py` inside
     there.
   
 * Fixed to throw an exception, rather than a Segmentation Fault, if
   run on Linux without DISPLAY properly set.
   
 * Fixed EDMC.exe (command line tool) to correctly report the version with
   `-v`.
   
Release 3.46
===

**This should be the final release of EDMC based on Python 2.7.** The next release after this, assuming this one doesn't introduce new bugs, will be based on Python 3.7.  Any plugins that users have installed will need to have been updated to work under Python 3.7 by the time that next version of EDMC is released.  ~~During EDMC startup, at most once per day, you might see a popup with the text:~~

> One or more of your enabled plugins do not yet have support for Python 3.x.  Please see the list on the 'Plugins' tab of 'File' > 'Settings'.  You should check if there is an updated version available, else alert the developer that they will need to update the code when EDMC moves to Python 3.x

A small bug means that popup will never appear, but you can still check "File" > "Settings" > "Plugins" tab and see what plugins are listed in the section with the text "Plugins Without Python 3.x Support".

If any of your plugins are listed in that section then they will need updating, by you or the original developer, to work with Python 3.7.  See <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/blob/main/PLUGINS.md#migration-to-python-37">Migrating To Python 3.7</a> for more information.


Changes in this version:

 * The CAPI CLIENT_ID has been changed to one under Athanasius' account, so when users are asked to (re-)authenticate with Frontier they'll see "Elite Dangerous Market Connector (EDCD/Athanasius)" as the application asking for permission.  There's been no change to the use of the data Frontier then gives access to.
 * Updated translations (as of 2019-09-26 in general and 2019-11-04 for Polish).
 * Linux: Should now appear on task bar whilst in dark mode theme.
	<li>INARA: Send correct opponentName for Interdicted and Interdiction events.<.li>
 * Send SAASignalsFound events to EDDN.
 * Add Agronomic Treatment introduced for a community goal.
 * Fix Detailed Surface Scanner rating.
 * Fix for the "Inara 400 The reputation value exceeds the valid range" error.
 * Minimum interval between checks for a new version of EDMC has been reduced from 47 hours to 8 hours.
 * There is a new option, within the 'Configuration' tab, 'Disable Automatic Application Updates Check when in-game' which when active should prevent update checks from showing a popup whilst you're in-game. You can still use "Help" > "Check for updates" to trigger a manual check.
 * Support added for the journal 'CarrierJump' event, triggered when you're docked on a Fleet Carrier as it performs a jump.  This is now sent to: EDDN, Inara, EDSM.  NB: EDSM doesn't yet support this event at the time of writing, so will still not track such Carrier Jumps in your Flight Log or current location.  Generally when EDSM is updated to handle such new events it will back-process stored unrecognised events.




Release 3.45
===

There was no real 3.45, it was 'burned' testing that updates from 3.44 would work with the new update_feed URL.


Release 3.44
===

**CHANGE OF MAINTAINER**


Due to a lack of time to give the project the attention it needs Marginal has handed over ownership of the EDMarketConnector GitHub repository to the EDCD (Elite Dangerous Community Developers) organisation.


Initially Athanasius will now be responsible for maintaining the code, including addressing any Pull Requests and Issues, and making releases.  Unfortunately he has no access to hardware running MacOS so can't easily generate builds for that platform or test them.  So for the time being releases will be for Windows 10 only.  MacOS users are advised to look into running from source (see the github README).


Going forwards the intention is to move to the python 3.7 code as soon as possible.  To facilitate this there will be one more python 2.7 release in addition to this one, with the main aim of that being to add code to alert the user about any plugins they use that have apparently not been updated to run under python 3.7.


See the project GitHub repository's <a href="https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a> for further information.
