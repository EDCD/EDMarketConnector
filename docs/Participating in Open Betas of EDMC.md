# EDMarketConnector

From time to time, EDMC may offer release candidates, beta tests, or other pre-release updates of EDMC. These are distributed to our users to help us put the final checks on various bug fixes and ensure that new features are working as intended. For EDMC, as of the testing of 5.11.0 we have formalized two update tracks that users can select. 

## The Stable Track

Stable-track releases are the traditional full releases of EDMC that have always been provided by the updater. We encourage most users to use this pathway. Releases on the Stable track are feature-complete and have gone through normal validation and testing methods to try and catch as many issues as possible. For users running from the source, this is generally the "main" branch.

## The Beta Track

Beta-track releases allow users to preview upcoming features, changes, bug fixes, and content additions before they are officially released. Participating in beta updates can provide you with early access to new content and the opportunity to provide feedback to us. Beta releases, by their very nature, are not as widely tested and may include significant bugs. We encourage users who are willing to help us develop and try new features, and work with us closely to fix discovered issues.

### Risks of Beta Updates

While participating in beta updates can be exciting and provide early access to new features, users need to be aware of the potential risks involved. Beta updates may contain bugs, glitches, or unintended interactions that could impact the overall program experience. Some betas may include features that alter configuration settings or internal system files in ways that are not compatible if a user tries to revert to a prior version.
