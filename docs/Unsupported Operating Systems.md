# EDMC is not supported on macOS or unsupported versions of Microsoft Windows. 

## Windows

### We cannot fully support an operating system their manufacturers no longer support.

Windows 8.1 entered End-Of-Life on January 10th, 2023. As such, we do not provide support or bug fixes to users on these operating systems. Additionally, we do not guarantee that EDMC will work on these systems.

Windows 7 and earlier will not launch EDMC, as the minimum Python versions do not work on that platform.

Our installer will not allow you to install the program on Windows 7, 8, and 8.1. We do not test for functionality on these platforms.

Versions of this application before 5.0.0 will work poorly, at best, against Elite Dangerous Odyssey. We provide no support for these older versions of EDMC.

Efforts to run an older version of EDMC on an outdated operating system will not receive support from our team. Please note that many listeners, such as EDDN, will discard data from old versions out of hand. Currently, data from any version before EDMC 5.6 will be discarded.

If you attempt to install workaround DLLs, spoof install requirements, journal entries, or in some other way alter EDMC, note that we do not endorse or support these actions and hold no liability for any issues that arise, including but not limited to malware infections, corrupted Windows files, poor performance, bugs, or degraded operational conditions.

### You really should upgrade your OS

We appreciate that some people are using hardware that is difficult to use Windows 10 or Windows 11 on and may not have the necessary financial means to obtain newer hardware.

We also understand (and share!) many concerns regarding Windows 10 and 11's privacy options and settings. However, we cannot in good conscience endorse using outdated and vulnerable software.

We emphasize that is in your best interests to be using an OS, and version, that is still supported by its vendor. We bear no responsibility if you choose to not do so.

### A note on Windows 10

Officially, Windows 10 reached end of support on October 15th, 2025. This means that officially, we can't guarantee support for EDMC on Windows 10. However, we have no plans to prevent EDMC from running on Windows 10.

## macOS

macOS dropped support for Elite on Mac over [half a decade ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/8f382v/frontier_is_dropping_support_for_elite_dangerous/). Despite this, the team maintained the code regarding macOS support in the code until the 5.11 release. Unfortunately, underlying changes to the macOS NSLibrary among others have allegedly made the existing macOS code not function. As none of the dev team members have access to legal ways to test and update this code, support for macOS was formally revoked in 5.11 and the underlying code (such as configuration data, hotkeys, specific translations, and UI patches) was removed.

If you want to run EDMC on macOS, we suggest using the packaged EXE files in an environment similar to WINE.
