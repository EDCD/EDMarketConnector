Elite: Dangerous Market Connector (EDMC)
===

This application is only of use to PC players of the game Elite Dangerous
(and its expansions).  It won't work with PS4 or Xbox accounts.

It utilises the Journal files written by the game on the user's computer,
together with data from the API Frontier Developments supplies in order to
feed this data to various third party sites that the user may find useful.

See [the Wiki documentation](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki)
for more details.

Packaging for distribution
--------
Please see [docs/Releasing.md](docs/Releasing.md).

Disclaimer
--------
This app uses the “Companion” web API that Frontier originally supplied for
their Elite Dangerous iOS app and now [support](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/open-letter-to-frontier-developments.218658/page-19#post-3371472)
for third-party apps. If that API ceases to function in the future then
much of this application's functionality will be curtailed (although it
could still utilise [Journal files](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/commanders-log-manual-and-data-sample.275151/#post4562494)).
