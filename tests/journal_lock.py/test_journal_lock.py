"""
Tests for journal_lock.py code.

Tests:
 - Is file actually locked after obtain_lock().  Problem: We opened the
    file in a manner which means nothing else can open it.  Also I assume
    that the same process will either be allowed to lock it 'again' or
    overwrite the lock.

    Expected failures if:

     1. Lock already held (elsewhere).
     2. Can't open lock file 'w+'.
     3. Path to lock file doesn't exist.
     4. journaldir is None (default on Linux).

 - Does release_lock() work?  Easier to test, if it's worked....
     1. return True if not locked.
     2. return True if locked, but successful unlock.
     3. return False otherwise.

 - JournalLock.set_path_from_journaldir
     1. When journaldir is None.
     2. Succeeds otherwise?

 - Can any string to pathlib.Path result in an invalid path for other
   operations?

 - Not sure about testing JournalAlreadyLocked class.
